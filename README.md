CPAN and meta::cpan interlinks
==============================

A Greasemonkey add-on that adds CPAN links to meta::cpan and vice-versa.

## DESCRIPTION

Some people prefer CPAN, some prefer meta::cpan. Often you end up on the wrong
site. This Greasemonkey script adds links to meta::cpan on every POD page rendered
to hop over to CPAN, if that is what you like better. In case you prefer meta::cpan,
this script does the same on CPAN, vice-versa.

[This script on userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/186311) where
you can also [install it](http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/186311.user.js).
